  abstract = {The Mechanics and Thermodynamics of Continua presents a unified treatment of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics that emphasises the universal status of the basic balances and the entropy imbalance. These laws are viewed as fundamental building blocks on which to frame theories of material behaviour. As a valuable reference source, this book presents a detailed and complete treatment of continuum mechanics and thermodynamics for graduates and advanced undergraduates in engineering, physics and mathematics. The chapters on plasticity discuss the standard isotropic theories and, in addition, crystal plasticity and gradient plasticity.},

  abstract = {Looking at the force balance (1.2.6), we see that we have only d equations for \$\$d(d+3)/2\$\$unknowns (namely d components of y and \$\$d(d+1)/2\$\$components of \$\$T\textasciicircum y\$\$). Therefore, we complete (1.2.6) by material constitutive relations describing particular materials as far as its elastic properties concerns. Such constitutive relations should involve the stress tensor and the deformation gradient and may be in general implicit, cf. (Rajagopal, Appl Math, 48:279–319 (2003), [409]). Without excluding too many applications, we confine ourselves to the case when the stress is explicitly determined by the strain.},
