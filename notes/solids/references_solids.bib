  abstract = {Looking at the force balance (1.2.6), we see that we have only d equations for \$\$d(d+3)/2\$\$unknowns (namely d components of y and \$\$d(d+1)/2\$\$components of \$\$T\textasciicircum y\$\$). Therefore, we complete (1.2.6) by material constitutive relations describing particular materials as far as its elastic properties concerns. Such constitutive relations should involve the stress tensor and the deformation gradient and may be in general implicit, cf. (Rajagopal, Appl Math, 48:279–319 (2003), [409]). Without excluding too many applications, we confine ourselves to the case when the stress is explicitly determined by the strain.},
