  abstract = {This paper describes an energy-preserving and globally time-reversible code for weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). We do not add any additional dynamics to the Monaghan's original SPH scheme at the level of ordinary differential equation, but we show how to discretize the equations by using a corrected expression for density and by invoking a symplectic integrator. Moreover, to achieve the global-in-time reversibility, we have to correct the initial state, implement a conservative fluid-wall interaction, and use the fixed-point arithmetic. Although the numerical scheme is reversible globally in time (solvable backwards in time while recovering the initial conditions), we observe thermalization of the particle velocities and growth of the Boltzmann entropy. In other words, when we do not see all the possible details, as in the Boltzmann entropy, which depends only on the one-particle distribution function, we observe the emergence of the second law of thermodynamics (irreversible behavior) from purely reversible dynamics.},

We devise a new approach based on Hamiltonian mechanics suitable for simulating thermally driven and weakly compressible flows with free surfaces. The method is then tested in three cases, including a simulation of the fountain effect. We obtain remarkable agreement with referential and theoretical results. The simulations provide new physical insight, such as the pressure and temperature fields in a vessel experiencing the fountain effect.}

  abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) methods are advantageous in simulations of fluids in domains with free boundary. Special SPH methods have also been developed to simulate solids. However, there are situations where the matter behaves partly as a fluid and partly as a solid, for instance, the solidification front in 3D printing, or any system involving both fluid and solid phases. We develop an SPH-like method that is suitable for both fluids and solids at the same time. Instead of the typical discretization of hydrodynamics, we discretize the Symmetric Hyperbolic Thermodynamically Compatible equations~(SHTC), which describe both fluids, elastic solids, and visco-elasto-plastic solids within a single framework. The resulting SHTC-SPH method is then tested on various benchmarks from the hydrodynamics and dynamics of solids and shows remarkable agreement with the data.},

  abstract = {We propose an alternative SPH scheme to usual SPH Godunov-type methods for simulating supersonic compressible flows with sharp discontinuities. The method relies on an adaptive density kernel estimation (ADKE) algorithm, which allows the width of the kernel interpolant to vary locally in space and time so that the minimum necessary smoothing is applied in regions of low density. We have performed a von Neumann stability analysis of the SPH equations for an ideal gas and derived the corresponding dispersion relation in terms of the local width of the kernel. Solution of the dispersion relation in the short wavelength limit shows that stability is achieved for a wide range of the ADKE parameters. Application of the method to high Mach number shocks confirms the predictions of the linear analysis. Examples of the resolving power of the method are given for a set of difficult problems, involving the collision of two strong shocks, the strong shock-tube test, and the interaction of two blast waves. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {This paper presents a brief review of grand challenges of Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. As a meshless method, SPH can simulate a large range of applications from astrophysics to free-surface flows, to complex mixing problems in industry and has had notable successes. As a young computational method, the SPH method still requires development to address important elements which prevent more widespread use. This effort has been led by members of the SPH rEsearch and engineeRing International Community (SPHERIC) who have identified SPH Grand Challenges. The SPHERIC SPH Grand Challenges (GCs) have been grouped into 5 categories: (GC1) convergence, consistency and stability, (GC2) boundary conditions, (GC3) adaptivity, (GC4) coupling to other models, and (GC5) applicability to industry. The SPH Grand Challenges have been formulated to focus the attention and activities of researchers, developers, and users around the world. The status of each SPH Grand Challenge is presented in this paper with a discussion on the areas for future development.},
